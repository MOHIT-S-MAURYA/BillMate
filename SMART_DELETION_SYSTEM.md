For existing widgets that don't have built-in delete functionality:
```dart
SmartDeletableItem(
  canDelete: true,
  onDelete: () => _deleteRecord(),
  child: ExistingCard(),
)
```

### **Pattern 2: Replace Popup Menu**
For widgets with existing popup menus:
```dart
// Before: PopupMenuButton with edit/delete
// After: SmartDeletableItem with canEdit: true
SmartDeletableItem(
  canEdit: true,
  canDelete: true,
  onEdit: () => _editRecord(),
  onDelete: () => _deleteRecord(),
  child: CleanCard(), // Removed popup menu
)
```

### **Pattern 3: Enhanced Floating Action**
For pages needing multiple quick actions:
```dart
SmartActionButton(
  actions: [
    SmartAction(icon: Icons.refresh, onTap: _refresh),
    SmartAction(icon: Icons.export, onTap: _export),
  ],
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
)
```

## ðŸ›¡ **Safety Features**

### **1. Confirmation System**
- Custom confirmation dialogs for each record type
- Specific item details in confirmation messages
- Clear warning about permanent deletion
- Two-step deletion process

### **2. Context-Aware Messaging**
```dart
// Payment History
'Are you sure you want to delete this payment record of â‚¹1,500? 
This action cannot be undone and will affect the invoice balance.'

// Invoice
'Are you sure you want to delete invoice INV-001? 
This action cannot be undone and will permanently remove 
all associated data including payment history.'

// Customer
'Are you sure you want to delete customer "John Doe"? 
This action cannot be undone.'
```

### **3. Visual Feedback**
- Touch animations (scale and fade effects)
- Color-coded backgrounds for swipe actions
- Progressive reveal of delete options
- Status-aware styling
