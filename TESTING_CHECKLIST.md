- [ ] Sample items added with known stock quantities
- [ ] Database version 4 with inventory_transactions table

## üß™ **TEST SCENARIOS**

### **Test 1: Basic Stock Reduction**
**Scenario**: Create invoice with available stock
```
Setup: Light item with stock = 10
Action: Create invoice for 3 lights
Expected Result:
‚úÖ Invoice created successfully
‚úÖ Light stock reduced to 7
‚úÖ Transaction record created (type: SALE, change: -3)
```

### **Test 2: Overselling Prevention**
**Scenario**: Try to sell more than available
```
Setup: Light item with stock = 5
Action: Try to create invoice for 8 lights
Expected Result:
‚ùå Invoice creation blocked
‚ùå Error message: "Only 5 available in stock"
‚ùå Stock remains at 5 (unchanged)
```

### **Test 3: Multi-Item Invoice Validation**
**Scenario**: Invoice with multiple items, one insufficient
```
Setup: Light (stock: 10), Fan (stock: 2)
Action: Create invoice for 5 lights + 5 fans
Expected Result:
‚ùå Invoice creation blocked
‚ùå Error message about insufficient stock
‚ùå No stock changes for any items
```

### **Test 4: Duplicate Item Handling**
**Scenario**: Same item added multiple times in one invoice
```
Setup: Light item with stock = 10
Action: Add 3 lights, then add 4 more lights (total 7)
Expected Result:
‚úÖ System validates total quantity (7) against stock (10)
‚úÖ Invoice created if total ‚â§ stock
‚úÖ Stock reduced by total quantity (10 ‚Üí 3)
```

### **Test 5: Stock Restoration on Invoice Deletion**
**Scenario**: Delete an existing invoice
```
Setup: Invoice exists for 5 lights (stock reduced to 5)
Action: Delete the invoice
Expected Result:
‚úÖ Invoice deleted successfully  
‚úÖ Light stock restored to 10
‚úÖ Return transaction recorded (type: RETURN, change: +5)
```

### **Test 6: Real-Time UI Validation**
**Scenario**: UI shows current stock information
```
Setup: Various items with different stock levels
Action: Open "Add Item" dialog
Expected Result:
‚úÖ Dropdown shows stock quantities: "Light - ‚Çπ100 (Stock: 10)"
‚úÖ Quantity field validates against available stock
‚úÖ Error messages appear in real-time
```

### **Test 7: Inventory Transaction Audit Trail**
**Scenario**: Verify complete transaction logging
```
Setup: Perform several operations (create, delete invoices)
Action: Check inventory_transactions table
Expected Result:
‚úÖ All stock movements recorded
‚úÖ Transaction types correct (SALE, RETURN)
‚úÖ Quantity changes accurate
‚úÖ Invoice references maintained
‚úÖ Timestamps recorded
```

### **Test 8: Low Stock Handling**
**Scenario**: Item reaches low stock threshold
```
Setup: Light with stock = 2, low_stock_alert = 5
Action: Create invoice for 1 light
Expected Result:
‚úÖ Invoice created (stock = 1)
‚úÖ Item appears in low stock list
‚úÖ Visual indicators for low stock
```

### **Test 9: Out of Stock Handling**
**Scenario**: Item stock reaches zero
```
Setup: Light with stock = 1
Action: Create invoice for 1 light
Expected Result:
‚úÖ Invoice created (stock = 0)
‚úÖ Item appears in out of stock list
‚ùå Cannot create new invoices for this item
```

### **Test 10: Error Recovery Testing**
**Scenario**: Network interruption during invoice creation
```
Setup: Simulate failure during stock reduction
Action: Create invoice, simulate failure
Expected Result:
‚úÖ Transaction rolled back
‚úÖ Stock levels unchanged
‚úÖ No partial data corruption
```

## üìä **DATABASE VERIFICATION QUERIES**

### **Check Current Stock Levels:**
```sql
SELECT name, stock_quantity, low_stock_alert
FROM items 
ORDER BY stock_quantity ASC;
```

### **View Transaction History:**
```sql
SELECT 
    i.name,
    it.transaction_type,
    it.quantity_change,
    it.previous_quantity,
    it.new_quantity,
    it.invoice_id,
    it.created_at
FROM inventory_transactions it
JOIN items i ON it.item_id = i.id
ORDER BY it.created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Stock Status:**
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    stock_quantity,
    CASE 
        WHEN stock_quantity <= 0 THEN 'OUT OF STOCK'
        WHEN stock_quantity <= low_stock_alert THEN 'LOW STOCK'
        ELSE 'SUFFICIENT'
    END as status
FROM items;
```

## üö® **KNOWN EDGE CASES TO TEST**

1. **Concurrent Sales**: Two users trying to buy the last item
2. **Large Quantities**: Testing with very large numbers
3. **Decimal Quantities**: Items sold in fractional amounts
4. **Network Failures**: Connection loss during transactions
5. **Database Locks**: Multiple simultaneous stock updates
6. **Data Migration**: Existing invoices with new system

---

## üìù **TESTING NOTES**

- Test each scenario multiple times
- Verify database state after each test
- Check for memory leaks during repeated operations
- Validate UI responsiveness with various data sizes
- Ensure proper error handling in all edge cases

**Status**: Ready for comprehensive testing ‚úÖ
